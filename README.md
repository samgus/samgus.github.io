## NYC Park Maintenance

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/samgus/samgus.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### What is the project about?

We want to test how often NYC parks receives maintenance depending on where they are built, what borough they are in, and that show when the park was built, what borough it is in, and when the last time they received maintenance.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/samgus/samgus.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
