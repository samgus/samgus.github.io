## NYC Park Maintenance

### What is the project about?

We want to test how often NYC parks receives maintenance depending on where they are built, what borough they are in, and that show when the park was built, what borough it is in, and when the last time they received maintenance.

### What is this significant?

Parks are so valuable and enrich the lives of so many New Yorkers. There’s nothing like being in a beautiful park that is very well taken care of.
